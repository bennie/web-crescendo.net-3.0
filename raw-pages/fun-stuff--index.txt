			Fun Stuff		</h2>
				<p>These are just some fun things I have put together over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/conbadge/">Conbadge Drinking Game</a></b> (Feb 2011)
<p>A meme generator based on the furry conbadge drinking game. Enter<br />
your badge name and it tells you how many drinks you score.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2F6ejSBgQU">Cross Country in 3 mins</a></b> (Feb 2010)
<p>A 2,850 mile drive time-lapsed in 3 minutes. Approximate visual speed of<br />
57,000 MPH. Boiling Springs Lake, NC to San Jose, CA. See if you can spot the<br />
USS North Carolina or Donner Pass. From my drive cross country in 2006.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8wiMgFdocw">The Move</a></b> (Feb 2010)
<p>Time lapsed video of the machine room move I helped with for HMS back on 2003.<br />
The entire company&#8217;s office and machine room was moved in a long weekend. I set<br />
up the camera to capture the action in the new machine room. The giant plush Tux<br />
was mine as well. He accidentally became the star of the video: Without<br />
any planning or coordination, we all ended up moving and posing tux for<br />
the camera. It is also available in the older <a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/the-move/the-move.avi">AVI</a> and <a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/the-move/the-move.rm">Real</a> formats.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.doemain.com/vinci/">The Vinci Doll</a></b> (Apr 2006)
<p>The surprise &#8220;talking Vinci doll&#8221; that we put together for Candy DeWalt, creator of<br />
<a href="http://www.vincifruit.com/">Vinci &amp; Arty</a>. It features a character<br />
from the strip saying a few interesting bits.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://old.crescendo.net/fun/images/milk.jpg">Forgot Milk?</a></b> (May 2005)
<p>So I had an odd impulse to make a quick parody ad when I found one of<br />
these. Whee.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/basement">The Basement Tour</a></b> (Aug 2004)
<p>Triggur&#8217;s tour was just too awesome. I had to have my own competeing<br />
one. Tongue-firmly-in-cheek, of course.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/images/fitness.jpg">Serious Fanboy Fitness</a></b> (Jul 2003)
<p>A quick chuckle and gift for a friend who makes the <a href="http://seriousfitness.griffinparkstudio.com/">Serious Fitness</a><br />
T-shirts.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/bingo/bingo.cgi">Triggur Bingo</a></b> (Mar 2003)
<p>Hang around Trig? Feel free to print one out and play along.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://old.crescendo.net/software/japh.html">A pile of JAPHs</a></b> (Jun &#8211; Dec 2002)
<p>Some friends and I were tossing JAPHs back and forth to each other. Here are some<br />
highlights.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.crescendo.net/fun/images/hunter.jpg">Hunter&#8217;s &#8220;Think Different&#8221;<br />
Ad</a></b> (Aug 2002)</p>
<p>Hunter didn&#8217;t let a small car wreck stop him. This is from the morning<br />
after, reclaiming his wallet from the console. It made a nice ad<br />
parody.</li>
</ul>
