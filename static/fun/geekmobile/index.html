<p>In this world there seem to be two camps of Geeks. There are the
&quot;Matrix&quot; geeks who desire to live in a world of mental
uplinks, deck boards, and to hear whispers to their ghost while in a
new shell. Then there are the &quot;Forest geeks&quot; who desire
nothing more than a multihome OC-48 cabin in the woods where people
leave them alone.</p>

<p>I am one of the latter. I make no excuses, this project is a direct
outlet from my quirky desires.</p>

<p>The goal is simple. To have the most rugged and indestructible portable
lan-party and internet access vehichle that is possible. That is which I
desire. I want to be able to drive up to Northern Ontario or through the
Great Dismal swamp and still check my E-mail, read slashdot, and write
webpages. I want to be able to read Sluggy Freelance when there is no one
else around me for 150 miles.</p>

<p>Deep forest computing.</p>

<p>The choice of vehichle was actually simple. Some of you may or may not
be familiar with the legacy of the Land Rover. I am not talking about the
fancy SUVs that your prissy executive bosses buy and drive back and forth
to work.</p>

<p>The Land Rover was Britan's equivalent to the American Jeep. It was
technically superior in many ways, from a rust-proof aircraft aluminum
skin, to a inch and a half steel firewall.</p>

<p>Since World War II the rover company took pride in building a
practically indestructible vehichle, taking aim for the Farming and
heavy-usage market.</p>

<p>The older series rover's where vehichles that could survive the
poutback desert, the frozen north, the swamps of south america, and
anything else that was remotely driveable. It has been made into tractors,
ambulances, dropped out of planes, turned into desert survival
vehichles. But I am getting off track. For an introduction, check out
the <a href="http://www.fourfold.org/LR_FAQ/FAQ.1.what_is.html">intro</a> 
from the <a href="http://www.fourfold.org/LR_FAQ/FAQ.1.what_is.html">Landrover
FAQ</a> more rover history.</p>

<p>Let's just say that there are very few vehichles in this world that can
be field dressed with a flat blade screwdriver and a crescent wrench. This
is one, thus this is the one.</p>

<p>The alpha release.</p>

<p>A good friend of mine pointed me to a dealership in my area that
recently started to import old series rovers from England.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skytoprover.com/"><img width="125" height="20" 
border="0" src="images/skytop.gif"></a></p>

<p>Skytop Rover, Inc. is currently importing the vehichles that the
British military are retiring. After kicking the tires and going for a
test ride or two, I selected my final contender.</p>

<p>The picture on the right is the rover I bought, right on the lot at
Skytop. It was retired from the BerkShire sharpshooters regiment. This was
an officer's vehichle. Unlike most of the other vehichles, it was not a
direct Military manufacturer. Instead of being mil-spec 24-volt, this is a
civilian chassis 12-volt that had been fitted.</p>

<p>All of the vehichles in this batch were convoy rigged radio
vehichles. Many of them were fixed with oversized alternators with idle
throttles to support radio broadcast. This vehichle, with radio fittings
and such, though, didn't have the goant alternator.</p>
