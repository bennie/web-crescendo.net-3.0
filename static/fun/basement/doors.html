<p>I call these the coal doors, but I do not know if they were. Being 
Pennsylvania, coal delivery is still available and was quite common. These 
are a typical set of the steel-angle doors that lead to the side yard. In 
defiance of the Pennsylvania winter, there is no insulation. When snow 
piles on these doors, they chill the room wonderfully.</p>

<p>There is a set of hand-made stone steps leading up and down. Note how 
the decor is heavily accented with cobwebs and an errant cable-television 
coax cable. Due to the age of the stonework, some of the plaster has 
crumbled to dust, revealing the exposed stones.</p>
