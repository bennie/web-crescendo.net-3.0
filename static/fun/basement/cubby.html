<p>This cubby is created by the supports for the fireplace up in the main 
living-room. Note how the base of the fireplace above sags 
disconcertingly down.</p>
<p>The boxes are storage and packing containers for various objects within 
the residence. They themselves are gaining an artistic status thanks to 
the heavy placement of cobwebs and the effects of moisture and reshaping 
the otherwise stiff cardboard.</p>
