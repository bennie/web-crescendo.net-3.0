<p>One of the many cuious items residing in the basement appears to be a 
round, hand cut wood beam. It is likely oak or chesnut given it's apparent 
age. If you look at the end there is a large post-socket indicating it's 
either sufficiently aged or home-made construction. It is well preserved 
and due to the damp nature of the basement, quite heavy.</p>
