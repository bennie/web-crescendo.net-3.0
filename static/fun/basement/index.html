<tr><td><p>Welcome to the kitchen.</p>
<p>My friend Kevin Kelm had a very nice and fun tour of his <a 
href="http://www.triggur.org/basement/">very new and quite
refined basement</a> now that the majority of renovations have been completed.</p>
<p>Kevin has quite a natch for class and style. Having such a wonderful online 
tour available made it simply impossible to not have one for myself. I must
keep up with the technical Jonses afterall, and though Trig has a spectacular
basement, I submit that he has <b><i>absolutetly nothing</i></b> in comparison 
to mine.</p>
<p>Here's a bonus point kiddiees. Can you guess which one of us is gay and which
one of us is a bachelor?</p>
