<p>The back corner, with the washer, is probably the most frequently used part
of the great room. As long as you don't mind the wiring in the ceiling directly brushing
your head as you work, it is a comfortable system.</p>

<p>Note how the water is drawn from the much older washtub system. As well, the 
decorative pile of old detergeant bottles.</p>

<p>The pegboard is from a previous resident and is damp from the natural humidity. The 
wall is whitewashed flagstone and mortar foundation.</p>
