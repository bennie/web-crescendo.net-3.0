<p>Featured in Kevin's tour of his basement is a separate room for his 
work activities. He doesn't have a thing on this workspace.</p>
<p>While ducking the beams and tripping over electric cords being used
to carry power from the only available and quite dirty source on the
other side of the room, you can focus on the centerpiece of this area,
the workbench.</p>
<p>It features a pine top hammered on to some boards and table legs 
that appear to have been slapped together by someone lacking a basic 
understanding of woodworking. The entire design could be described as 
"organic" since it is neither square, nor sitting level, nor stable.</p>
<p>A selection of tools that looks like they might successfully replace a 
light-bulb are available. As well as trash from a previous "unbox the car 
stereo speakers" project. The vice in the background is at least 30 years 
old and is as loose as a octogenarian whore.</p>
