<p>A very typical farmer's style in-the-wall cabinet resides here. It is surprisingly 
deep, giving ample room for old chinese take-out-menus and enough macaroni and ramen
to choke a horse.</p>
<p>Note the large and well-versed selection of high-caloric snack foods such as an enitre
case of microwave popcorn, a barrel of pretzels, and no less than a half dozen (all open)
bags of chips.</p>
<p>The top cabinet is tastefully filled with cheap liquor. It's not
a full blown bar, but it does have a satisfying spread of liquors that will get your
hammered. Some of them are even in glass bottles. One or two don't have screw tops!</p>
