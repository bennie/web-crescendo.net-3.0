<p>Here the playfullness of the decor is exposed. Amongst this tableau of 
bottles only one has detergeant. Can you guess which one?</p>
<p>The shelves and drawers are all donated by previous residents. Note the 
use off 1 by 4's to function as a tabletop. Very chic and inventive. As is 
the dynamic placement of the used wiring sculpture that the creator refers 
to as "that used wiring we should throw out."</p>
