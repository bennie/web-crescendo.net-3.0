<p>Now here is something that I positively know that Kevin doesn't have in 
his basement. An old window-pane cover leans against the wall. The damp 
wall, long having lost its plaster, slowly wicks moisture down onto the

positive haze of mold, slime and decay is available at the base of this 
item. Beat that!</p>
