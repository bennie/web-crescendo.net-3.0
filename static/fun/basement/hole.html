<p>Though it might be considered a commentary upon the condition of other 
parts of the house, this is a certifiable hole in the wall.</p>
<p>Note the unsheltered pipes that go under the kitchen. Thankfully, 
due to poor insulation and the resulting heat leakage, these pipes 
don't quite freeze in the winter.</p>
<p>Visible due to the flash are the foundations for both chimneys that 
used to reside in the kitchen. They've since been closed up. Not visible 
in this picture are the three bodies, one of which is a defiled and 
restrained zombie, that are stored around the corner next to the crypt and 
altar to Ba'al.</p>
