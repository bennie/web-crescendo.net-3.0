<p>So here's the door going into the basement. Note the positively 
ancient style doorknob and high-tech post-and-hole lock to keep the
door from opening when it shrinks in the wintertime. It's summertime
so the non-ventilated humidity makes sure that's not as big a concern.</p>
<p>Also of note is the liquor and canned goods in the wall cabined and
the fine layer of dirt stains on the edge of the door.</p>
