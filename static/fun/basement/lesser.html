<p>The design of the lesser hall is significantly more industrial than the
great hall and is dominated by the fuel-oil driven combination heater and
hot-water-heater. The heater draws from an oil tank to the left and vents
up the very old fire place behind.</p>

<p>Also noticable in the center are the steel doors of the coal-hopper
entrance. Hardly used, they are protected by a fine mesh of cobwebs.</p>
