<p>This is the grand archway to the lesser hall. Not the fine
crafstmanship that might indicate that at one time this arch may have been
worthy of a door. Note how the central foundation still has gaps between
the beams so that all manner of insects and air may circulate between
rooms. A breathless design.</p>
