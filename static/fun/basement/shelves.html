<p>Here we see the fine decor is continued in a post-apocalyptic bachelor 
motif. Note the Ironing board that appears to never have been used. 
It is well placed amongst the unused construction supplies and old screen 
door.</p>
<p>Items of note include an old cat-water dish, coolers, old halloween 
decorations and a case of bottles used for home-brew. On the lower right 
is a case that features the final bottle of buckwheat honey champgne 
style mead that has been aging for more than 5 years.</p>
