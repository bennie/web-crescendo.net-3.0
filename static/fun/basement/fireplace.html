<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the lesser hall is this enormous 
fireplace, which has since been sealed and is being used for venting the 
heater. In general the stonework of the lesser hall is older, and coupled 
with this large fireplace might indicated that this portion of the 
basement was the original house or cabin the larger farmhouse was built 
on.</p>

<p>Note the large wooden beam, hose end is exposed. It shows natural axe 
cuts and is some 20 inches across. It is cut into being the supporting 
sash for the width of what must have been a 4 foot wide fireplace. Some 
indications in the ceiling show that after the house was expanded, this 
may have remained the kitchen for a period of time.</p>
