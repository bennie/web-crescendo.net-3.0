<p>Both the sink and the sump pump drain into an open ended 6-inch-wid
cast iron pipe that seems to be embedded in the floor. About what I can
figure, it drains out in the front yard about 20 yards away from the
house. That would mean that when the house was built, this was a natural
way of keeping the absement from filling with water as the pipe travels
downhill the whole way. Who knows?</p>
