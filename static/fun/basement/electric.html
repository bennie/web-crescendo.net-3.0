<p>A strong electrical service and new box are purched into this older 
house. The problem seems to be what happens from there. Three successive 
layers of wiring appear to be in place.</p>

<p>The oldest is hot-and-cold twisted cloth-insulated wiring probably 
from pre-1950. Most of the built-in fixtures and some rooms reside on this 
wiring which is all switched to a single 30 amp breaker. The next layer 
appears to be late-60s cloth-tube and plastic wiring that the predominance 
of outlets around the house are switched with. This includes the 
dust-catching flush-floor fire-starting outlets in the living room. The 
final layering of wiring is a hapahzard update of modern wiring to the 
main appliances and various outlet services for computers and 
air-conditioners on isolated breakers.</p>
