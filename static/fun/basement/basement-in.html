<p>As we enter the Great Hall, our eyes are greeted with the veritable
buffet of pleasing aspects in the layout, decor and design.</P> <p>This is
an old farmhouse, and as such the floor features hand-poured and non-level
cement, the ceiling is at the airy height of 5'8" or so. The decor is
strongly typed with cobwebs and dim lighting. Spaciously placed around the
room are floor-jacks to support the hundred-years-old hand cut floor
beams.</p> <p>Noted in the decor is that items are stored up on boards and
bricks for the inevitable seasonal flooding and puddling of water in a
porous and natural stone basement. Once such is can be seen in the center
background.</p> <p>Tastefully featured in the pile in the foreground is a
brand-new and unboxed, amber monochrome monitor. Additional decoration
feature piles of laundry being washed, and used wiring, plexiglass, and
detergent bottles.</p>
