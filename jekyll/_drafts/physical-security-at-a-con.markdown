So how to you keep an eye on 24 thousand fans in a hotel and convention center? Recently I had the pleasure of volunteering with a team of folks to do just that.

It's an interesting physical security problem, but probably has many observable analog on responsibilities in cybersecurity as well.

**Who?**

The Dorsei Irregulars are a group of scifi fans that have volunteered to staff fan conventions since the early 1970's. According to their own history, their origin stems from a specific security failing:

  At Torcon 2, the 31st World Science Fiction Convention (or "WorldCon"), held in 1973 in Toronto, the only security force was hired security guards. There was friction between the guards and the fans. The guards did not understand the fannish milieu. One miscreant fan stole one of noted illustrator Kelly Freas's paintings from the Art Show. The story goes that he showed the rental guard at the door a receipt for a piece of much lower value. The guard didn't know any better and let him through.

  However it happened, it left a lot of people upset and worried about what was happening in the science fiction fan community.

I have intereacted with them off and on for several conventions and have volunteered for them before.

This year, I worked with them at Magfest, which is probably the largest convention.

**Guiding principles**

Embedded in this design are a few design principles:

- short shifts for concentration
- clear lines of responsibility and ownership
- efficient cross-team communication
- escalation mangement
- documentation
- descalation
