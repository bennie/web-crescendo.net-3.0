**Notes**

Basically, almost any vegetables can be put in this soup - cabbage is a nice addition - use your imagination and stay healthy.

This soup boosts the immune system and assists the body to "get better" from any ailment 
or illness -- it is packed with vegetables and also detoxes the body while you heal. To 
"get better" quickly make a large pot of this super soup and eat ONLY SOUP and WATER for 
48 to 72 hours. This recipe was give to us by our chairopractic doctor when our son had 
strep throat. He was better in 48 hours without the aid of any drug or medecine. Since 
then, it is our drug of choice for everything and it always works perfectly.

This soup is so good that sometimes just the act of starting to make the soup causes the child to suddently feel "much better" and go to school.
