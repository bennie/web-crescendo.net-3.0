My grandmother used cookbooks sparingly. But this one recipe was pinned to a kitchen
cabinet for quick reference. It creates its own crust, has a creamy center, and a textured
top.

4 eggs - well beaten\
1 3/4 cups of sugar\
1/2 cup self rising flour\
2 cups of milk\
1/2 stick melted butter\
1 tsp. vanilla\
14 oz package of shredded coconut

Mix all, put batter in standard pie pan

Bake at 350 F for 30-40 min
