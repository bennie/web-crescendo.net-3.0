**Directions**

Start with as many chicken drumsticks as you think you can reasonably eat in a week, then add more. Clean the skin of any hard, yellow bits. Put all of these in a really big pot. Fill pot with water to 3/4, or so, then bring to a boil. 

Back down from boil to medium heat. Add chopped carrots and celery till it looks like the kind of soup grandma would make. Take two or three large, sweet onions. Halve, then halve again, add to pot. Add herbed chicken bouillon to taste.

Simmer all day till onions and chicken legs fall apart. Use tongs to remove bones.

To serve, cook whatever rice or soup noodles you like and add to a bowl of the soup. Add salt as needed.
