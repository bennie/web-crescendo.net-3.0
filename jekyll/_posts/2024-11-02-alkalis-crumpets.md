Crumpets are the quintessential afternoon tea treat, served warm with lots of
butter. Different from the original recipe of flat griddle cakes, the soft,
spongy crumpets we know today are a product of the Victorian era. It is the
extra yeast in the batter which creates the soft texture and the myriad of
holes on the top, perfect for soaking up butter.

Make a little extra batter your first time so you can practice getting them
right, including getting the pan to the proper temperature. It only takes
making one or two crumpets to get the hang of it.

Fun to make, just be sure to plan ahead as the batter can take an hour or
two to rise.

**Ingredients**

* 1 1/2 cups of milk
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 1/2 cups water (lukewarm)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder

**Directions**

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. First, warm the milk in a saucepan. Make sure that it is warm, but not boiling.
3. Skim any film off of the top.
4. Whisk together the warmed milk, flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl.
5. Once combined, add half the water and bear into the batter.
6. Continue to add more water until the batter is thick and smooth. Stop adding water once it reaches the consistency of thick cream.
7. Cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm, draft-free place until foaming. This should take about 1 hour, but it can be up to 2 hours. (keep an eye on it)
8. Whisk the sale and backing powder into the batter.
9. Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan on the stove until hot, but not smoking.
10. Moisten a paper towel with a little oil and grease the base of the pan and crumpet (or pastry) rings measuring approximately 3 x 1 1/2 inches.
11. Place one ring in the heated pan, and pour in enough batter to fill just below the top of the ring.
12. Cook for 5 minutes, until there are many tiny holes on the surface, and the crumpet is setting.
13. Flip the crumpet over (in the ring) and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.
14. Repeat with the remaining batter.
15. Rest the crumpets on a wire rack until cool.
16. To reheat, place crumpets in a toaster or under the broiler before serving.
17. Serve with lots of butter and jam.

Yields 24 crumpets.

**Notes**

* If the crumpet batter seeps out from under the ring into the pan, it means it is too thin. Whisk in more flour to thicken, adding a small amount at a time.
* If a cooked crumpet is heavy and without holes, the batter is too thick; slowly add more water until a better consistency develops.
* If you don't have any pastry or crumpet rings, you can use a similar sized, clean food can - just be careful with any sharp edges.
