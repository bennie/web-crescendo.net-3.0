**Ingredients**

* 1 cup of self-rising flour
* 1 cup of sugar
* 1 cup of milk
* large can of slices peaches
* 1/2 stick of butter

**Directions**

Mix the batter: sugar, flour, and milk

In a deep pie-dish or baking dish, melt a half-stick of butter.

Add the batter to the dish.

Add the peaches including syrup. Do not stir, just add on top.

Bake at 350 F for 30-40 min, until golden on top.

**Notes**

Traditionally White Lily self-rising flour is a brand used in southern recipes like this.
It has a lower protein and gluten content, which supposedly results in a lighter, fluffier
baked good with a greater rise. 

You can substitute the peaches with about any fruit. If you are using fresh fruits you may
wish to maserate them a little to bring out the flavor, since there will be no syrup from
the can to do that.
